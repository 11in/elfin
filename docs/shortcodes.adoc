= Shortcodes

11ty makes use of link:https://www.11ty.dev/docs/shortcodes/[shortcodes], which are essentially re-usable bits defined at the generator level.

[TIP]
====
For re-usable pieces of code defined at the template level, take a look at link:https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#macro[Nunjucks "macros."]
====

Elfin comes with a number of shortcodes built in that you might find helpful.
If you'd like to add your own shortcodes, check out link:extending.adoc[Extending 11ty].

== asset_image

Get the path to an image file that's tracked as part of our assets.

For instance, if you put an image in `assets/images/dog.jpg`, you can do the following to get its path:

[source,html]
----
<img src={% asset_image assets, 'dog.jpg' %} />
<!-- <img src="images/dog-4ccafcc9a11e688e7e3c.jpg" /> -->
----

The point of this is that it will return the slightly modified path and content hash that are created by the build process.

== asset_inline

This will return the content of an asset file.
Primarily this will be useful for inlining SVGs
(instead of treating them like traditional images).

[WARNING]
====
This shortcode will not prevent you from attempting to inline files you really shouldn't inline, like JPGs or PNGs.
It should also go without saying, but *never inline user-provided files*!
====

[source,html]
----
{% asset_inline assets, 'map.svg' %}
<!-- <svg><path d="M15.1517 4.7391L15.8936 ... ></svg> -->
----
