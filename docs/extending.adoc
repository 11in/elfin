= Extending 11ty

11ty is extremely flexible and can be configured to do a whole lot of things.
The link:https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/#using-the-configuration-api[Configuration API] is behind most of this flexibility.
While you can (and should) read through the above document and get started right away, Elfin includes a framework for structuring your configurations in a way that makes the easier to see and analyze, and doesn't crowd up your 11ty config file.

This framework can be used (or expanded) for any use of the Configuration API, but the following example demonstrates how to use it for adding a filter.

1. Create a `.js` file for your new filter in `11ty/filters/`.
i.e. if you're making an `uppercase` filter you might create `11ty/filters/uppercase.js`.
The name doesn't matter, but it helps make your code more readable.
2. In your new file, all the following:
+
[source,javascript]
----
module.exports = conf => {}
----
+
`conf` is an object we pass through from elsewhere that contains the link:https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/#using-the-configuration-api[11ty Configuration API].
3. Using the Configuration API, add your filter inside of the method body we just defined:
+
[source,javascript]
----
module.exports = conf => {
    conf.addFilter('uppercase', function(string) {
        return string.toUpperCase();
    });
}
----
4. Now we need to let the rest of 11ty know about the filter.
Open up `11ty/filters/index.js`, and add the following:
+
[source,javascript]
----
// ...
const uppercase = require('./uppercase');

module.exports = conf => {
    // ...
    uppercase(conf);
};
----
(The name used in `require('./uppercase')` is the filename you created in step #1)
5. Use your filter in a template, i.e. `{{ some_variable | uppercase }}`!
