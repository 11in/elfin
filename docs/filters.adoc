= Filters

11ty makes use of link:https://www.11ty.dev/docs/filters/[filters] which are a way to modify content on the fly in your templates.

Currently, Elfin ships with only one filter, which is entirely useless and exists only to demonstrate how to add and use custom filters.
If you'd like to add your own filters, checkout out link:extending.adoc[Extending 11ty].

== example_filter

This filter is useless:
All it does is reverse whatever string is passed to it.

{{ 'hello' | example_filter }}
