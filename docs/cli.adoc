= CLI

There are some repetetive tasks you may need to do with a package like this, so there's a CLI to help you with some of those.

If you find yourself needing a particular tool in the CLI, feel free to submit a PR or a feature request issue.

== Usage

To run the cli, you can do:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./cli/elf
----

If you'd like to make things a little easier on yourself, you can do this:

[source,bash]
----
$ npm link
$ elf
----

[WARNING]
====
This will globally link the `elf` executable in this particular project, so remember to run `npm unlink` when you're done--otherwise you may get some strange results in other projects.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure you have the appropriate `bin` directory in your path.
(It'll show you the path in the output of `npm link`.)
Otherwise `npm link` won't work.
====

== Tools

=== make

`elf make` helps you to quickly scaffold extentions to 11ty--and eventually other things as well, like templates, partials, etc.

All current `make` types come with default stub files that add essentially useless placeholder code.
If you want to use your own stubs, you can do so by passing a path to the `--stub` option when calling the command:

[source,bash]
----
elf make collection ships --stub ./collections.stub
----

[NOTE]
====
Your custom stubs can contain whatever you like, but they will be parsed as link:https://github.com/janl/mustache.js[mustache] templates, and will be passed all the arguments the function recieved from the command line. 
That means you can do something like this:

[source,javascript]
----
// custom.stub
console.log('{{ custom_arg }}')
----

[source,bash]
----
$ elf make filter example_filter --stub ./custom.stub --custom_arg 'Hello there'
----

[source,js]
----
// filters/example_filter.js
console.log('Hello there')
----
====

Currently, `make` can create three types of things:

`elf make collection`:: Creates an link:https://www.11ty.dev/docs/collections/[11ty collection].
You can optionally pass an argument to `--glob` to define the glob used to collect files, i.e. `+elf make collection ships --glob 'ships/**/*.md'+`.
If you don't, the collection generated will get all files.

`elf make filter`:: Creates an link:https://www.11ty.dev/docs/filters/[11ty filter]
(specifically a Universal Filter).
Read more about link:filters.adoc[Elfin's filters].

`elf make shortcode`:: Create an link:https://www.11ty.dev/docs/shortcodes/[11ty shortcode]
(specifically a Universal Shortcode).
Read more about link:shortcodes.adoc[Elfin's filters].

For more information on any of these things, just call them with the `--help` argument:

[source,bash]
----
elf make collection --help
----
