= Redirects

Oftentimes you'll need to do either a permanent of temporary redirect of a URL.
The most common time for this is when transitioning from one URL scheme to another.

If you're using Elfin with link:https://netlify.com[Netlify], it will automatically generate a Netlify-compatible redirects file.

== Types of redirects

Elfin has two types of redirects:

- Canonical
- Alias

**Canonical** redirects are permanent
(i.e. they are 301 redirects)
so they are more suitable to the "moving to a new URL scheme" use-case.

**Alias** redirects are not
(i.e. they are 302 redirects)
so they are more suitable to situations where you need some URL to point to an already existing page for a while, but don't want that redirect cached long-term.

== Using redirects

The redirect system is based off of the idea that you have an entry (i.e. a `.md` file) and you want other URLs to be redirect to the URL for that entry.

If you want to use a Canonical redirect, then add the following to the frontmatter of your entry:

[source,yaml]
----
redirect: '/the/other/url'
# Arrays are also supported
redirect:
  - '/yet/another/url'
  - '/a/mysterious/url'
----

Alias redirects are done the same, but use the "Alias" key:

[source,yaml]
----
alias: '/marketing/url/of/some/type'
# Or...
alias:
  - '/holiday/2020'
  - '/all/things/fade/in/time'
----

[WARNING]
====
Remember that 301 redirects are cached by the browser for a very long time--potentially forever!
Only set Canonical redirects when you're very certain you want them.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
The url(s) that you enter under `alias` or `redirect` are the *from* urls, and the permalink of the item you put them on is the *to* url.
The redirect will go _from_ the alias/cannonical redirect _to_ the permalink.
